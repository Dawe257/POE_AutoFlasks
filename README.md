POE AutoFlasks is a lite and fast program which can help to automate the use of flasks in <b>Path of Exile</b>.
<hr>

We frequently need to press a large number of keys during the game. 
In stressful situations, we may forget to use some flasks.
That’s why, the opportunity to develop the powerful character’s potential can be lost.
POE AutoFlasks contributes to facilitate this process.
User only need to press one key and all flasks will be used.

Emulated keydowns occur with a delay (from 0 to 0.3 sec and every time it’s random to exclude the possibility of being disconnected from the game)
<hr>
POE AutoFlasks needs pynput:
<ul>
  <li>pip install pynput</li>
</ul>
