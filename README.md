POE AutoFlasks is a small, fast program that will help to automate the use of flasks in <b>Path of Exile</b>.
<hr>

Very often we need to press a large number of keys during the game. 
In a stressful situation, we may forget to use some flask.
Because of this, the opportunity to unleash the full potential of the character is lost.
I wanted to make it easier for myself and share my solution.
You only need to press one key and all flasks will be used.

Emulated keydowns occur with a delay (from 0 to 0.3 sec and everytime its randomly to exclude the possibility of being disconnected from the game)
<hr>
POE AutoFlasks needs pynput:
<ul>
  <li>pip install pynput</li>
</ul>
